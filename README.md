These projects are form CS-368 - C++ for Java Developers

The semester long project(1 credit class) was to use OOP of C++ to build a mock application of "Safer Badgers", an app UW used to track COVID within the university.
Features from Safer Badgers are mimiced locally via a terminal application.  Data used by the application is persistent across runs.  The many different projects in this repo are
each a feature install.  The final project is the full functionality.
